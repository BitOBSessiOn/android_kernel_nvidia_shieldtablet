config TEGRA_NVDUMPER
	bool "Enable NvDumper for post-mortem debugging"
	default n
	help
	  The nvdumper is a tool that saves a copy of RAM following a crash.
	  nvdumper kernel module tracks whether the system has been rebooted
	  cleanly. It does this by writing 'dirty' to a fixed physical memory
	  address when the kernel starts.
	  Then, on a planned reboot, we write 'clean' to this location.
	  The bootloader can then examine this location and see if the reboot
	  was dirty or clean.
	  It will dump the contents of memory after a dirty reboot.
	  This tool would be helpful for debugging kernel crash.
	  In order to use this feature, you should enable debug feature in
	  bootloader compiling option also (-DENABLE_NVDUMPER).
	  You can dump RAM with nvflash tool in dirty boot status.
	  usage: nvflash --dumpram [phy. RAM offset] [length] <filename>
